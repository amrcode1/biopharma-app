      This app shall allow you to visualize relationships between patients. The patients listed were obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison
  from Dr. William H. Wolberg. He assessed biopsies of breast tumours for 699 patients up to 15 July
  1992; each of nine attributes has been scored on a scale of 1 to 10, and the outcome is also known.
  There are 699 rows and 11 columns.

      The tutorial inside the github repository of this application explains to you how you 
      can build a heatmap for one dimensional clustering and a phylogenetic tree for 
      one dimensional clustering. You also learn to insert exploratory inputs to allow you to search
      through the data set.

    <div class="task">
      
      Your task is to build an input that allows the researcher to find out, which parameters really help differentiating
      between "benign" and "malignant" tumors. Additionally you shall help the researcher to check
      if any different clustering algorithm might change the result.
